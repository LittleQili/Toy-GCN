# GCN-Based Model for Drug Molecular Toxicity Prediction

SJTU 2020 Fall CS410 course project 1

A GCN-based model, implemented for drug molecular toxicity prediction task([detail](https://github.com/LittleQili/trygcn/blob/submit/CS410%20Project%201%20Specification%20(2020%20Autumn).pdf), [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs410-2020-fall-ai-project-1/)). 

This model is based on Thomas Kipf's work in [pygcn](https://github.com/tkipf/pygcn) repository. I made tricky modification of the basic GCN layer, and got 0.863 AUC score.
